# OpenGL-Rasterizer
A renderer made from scratch with OpenGL 3.3, GLSL, and C++. This was created to learn the graphics pipeline and OpenGL. At the moment it contains texture mapping, Blinn-Phong lighting, specular normalization, SSAO, and a gui using ImGui. Currently working on adding shadow and normal mapping.
